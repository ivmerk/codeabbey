/*As we know, the Pythagorean Theorem tells us about the simple equation:

a^2 + b^2 = c^2
There really exist such triples a, b, c of integer numbers, which satisfy this equation. This is not self-evident fact, moreover there are no such triples for any other powers except 2 - this is the famous Fermat Theorem which could not be solved for more than 350 years.

However, for the power of 2 there are countless amount of such triples. One of them 3, 4, 5, for example.

Nevertheless, it is not always easy to find a triple satisfying some specific conditions:

In this problem you need to write a program which for given value of s = a + b + c will find the only triple which satisfies the equation.

For example, given sum of 12 the only 3, 4, 5 triple fits, for sum 30 the only 5, 12, 13 etc.

Input data will contain the number of test-cases in the first line.
Other lines will contain a single value each - the sum for which triple should be found.
Answer should contain the values of c^2 for each triple found (it is equal to a^2 + b^2 of course), separated with spaces.

Note: the real values of s would be large enough, about 10e+7 - so the simplest solutions could be inefficient.

Example:

input data:
2
12
30
